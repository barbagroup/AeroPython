## Aerodynamics-Hydrodynamics with Python

"Aerodynamics-Hydrodynamics" (MAE 6226) is taught at the George Washington University by Prof. Lorena Barba. The first version of the course ran in Spring 2014 and these IPython Notebooks were prepared for that class, with assistance from Barba-group PhD student Olivier Mesnard. In Spring 2015, we are revising and extending the collection.
